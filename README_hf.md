# Crypto Intelligence Pro

Crypto Intelligence Pro is an advanced market analysis tool for cryptocurrencies. It provides real-time price trends, sentiment analysis, technical indicators, and AI-powered market forecasts.

  

## Features

  

-  **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Retrieves historical OHLC price data from CoinGecko using cached API requests through [`app/services/data_fetcher.py`](app/services/data_fetcher.py).

-  **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes cryptocurrency-related news articles by fetching links and processing content via Groq AI Model in [`app/services/crypto_analyzer.py`](app/services/crypto_analyzer.py).

-  **Technical Analysis:** Computes technical indicators such as 7-day and 14-day SMAs, volatility, and price percentage changes to help determine market trends.

-  **Interactive Visualizations:** Displays dynamic charts using Plotly, including line, candlestick, OHLC, and pie charts for sentiment distribution ([app/utils/visualization.py](app/utils/visualization.py)).

-  **AI-Powered Market Forecasts:** Generates comprehensive market insights and predictions using Groq-powered AI models.
